# vOS Project Summary

## Overview

The **Virtual Embedded Operating System (vOS)** is a comprehensive educational project designed to simulate a complete embedded operating system using only VSCode and C++[1]. This project provides hands-on experience with embedded systems concepts without requiring actual hardware, making it an ideal learning platform for understanding operating system fundamentals, real-time scheduling, device drivers, and system architecture[1].

## Core System Components

### Kernel Architecture

The vOS kernel implements a static singleton pattern with global tick management, device registry, and subsystem initialization[1]. The kernel maintains a 100ms tick system that drives all time-based operations including task scheduling and system heartbeat monitoring[1].

### Task Scheduling System

The project progresses from cooperative scheduling to advanced real-time algorithms[1]:

- **Basic Cooperative Scheduler**: Round-robin execution with state management (READY, RUNNING, WAITING)[1]
- **Priority-based Scheduling**: Support for 8 priority levels with preemption capabilities[1]
- **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**: Automatic priority assignment based on task periods[1]
- **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**: Dynamic priority assignment based on absolute deadlines[1]

### Device Driver Framework

The plugin system enables modular hardware drivers through dynamic DLL loading[1]:

- **C-compatible Interface**: Standardized driver API using `extern "C"` functions[1]
- **Runtime Loading**: Automatic discovery and loading of drivers from the `drivers/` directory[1]
- **Virtual Hardware Simulation**: Abstract device classes with polymorphic I/O operations[1]

### Virtual Filesystem

The VFS provides Unix-style device access through `/dev/` paths, mapping device objects to filesystem locations for unified I/O operations[1]. This system supports device registration, path-based access, and comprehensive device status monitoring[1].

## Advanced Features

### Real-time Capabilities

The system implements sophisticated real-time features essential for embedded applications[1]:

- **Deadline Monitoring**: Tracks task execution times and triggers alerts for deadline violations[1]
- **Priority Inheritance**: Prevents priority inversion through mutex locks with automatic priority boosting[1]
- **Schedulability Analysis**: Mathematical validation that all deadlines can be met using Liu & Layland theorems[1]

### Communication Protocols

The project includes comprehensive communication stacks[1]:

- **UART Implementation**: Full protocol stack with configurable baud rates, flow control, and error detection[1]
- **Wireless Communication**: Simulated WiFi/Bluetooth with packet management and basic security features[1]

### Security Framework

Advanced security features protect the virtual embedded system[1]:

- **Secure Boot**: Cryptographic signature verification for all loaded components[1]
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption with secure key management[1]
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive forensic analysis capabilities with tamper-resistant storage[1]

## Development Environment

### Technical Requirements

The entire project requires only standard desktop development tools[1]:

- **VSCode**: Primary development environment with IntelliSense and debugging support[1]
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC, Clang, or MSVC with C++17 standard library support[1]
- **Standard Libraries**: Uses `std::chrono`, `std::thread`, and `std::filesystem` for system simulation[1]

### Virtual Hardware Simulation

All hardware components are implemented as software abstractions[1]:

- **Memory-mapped I/O**: `std::map` simulates hardware registers[1]
- **Interrupt Handling**: Software callbacks simulate hardware interrupts[1]
- **Real-time Clock**: `std::chrono` provides precise timing without hardware timers[1]

## Educational Value
