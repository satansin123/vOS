# Task 6 - Interrupt Request (IRQ) Simulation

## **Difficulty: Medium**

**Task 6.1: Basic Interrupt Simulation Framework**

Implement a software-based interrupt simulation system that can generate, queue, and process interrupt requests asynchronously using separate threads to simulate hardware interrupts[1][2].

**Problem Description:**

Embedded systems rely heavily on interrupt-driven programming for real-time responsiveness. Your task is to create a virtual interrupt controller that simulates hardware interrupts using software threads. Each interrupt source runs in its own thread and can trigger interrupt service routines (ISRs) asynchronously, mimicking how real hardware interrupts work[2].

**Requirements:**
- Create an `InterruptController` class that manages virtual IRQ sources
- Support multiple interrupt sources (Timer, UART, GPIO, etc.)
- Implement interrupt queuing with priority levels
- Use separate threads to simulate asynchronous interrupt generation
- Provide ISR registration and execution framework

**Input:** Interrupt source configuration and ISR callbacks
**Output:** Interrupt events and ISR execution status

**Example Interrupt Framework:**
```cpp
InterruptController irqController;
irqController.registerISR(IRQ_TIMER, [](){
    std::cout  uart_buffer(256);

// In ISR context
void uart_isr() {
    uint8_t data = read_uart_register();
    uart_buffer.push_from_isr(data);
}

// In main context  
while(!uart_buffer.empty()) {
    uint8_t data = uart_buffer.pop();
    process_uart_data(data);
}
```

**Constraints:**
- Buffer sizes: power of 2 (64, 128, 256, 512 bytes)
- Lock-free implementation required
- Memory ordering guarantees for all platforms
- Zero data loss under normal operating conditions

## **Difficulty: Medium**

**Task 6.4: Hardware Interrupt Source Simulation**

Create realistic interrupt source simulators for common embedded peripherals (UART, Timer, GPIO) that generate interrupts based on configurable timing and external events[1][4].

**Problem Description:**

To properly test interrupt-driven code, you need realistic interrupt sources that behave like actual hardware. Your simulators must generate interrupts at appropriate intervals and frequencies, support different trigger modes (edge/level), and provide configurable timing characteristics that match real embedded peripherals[4].

**Requirements:**
- Implement Timer interrupt source with configurable periods
- Create UART interrupt simulation with data transmission
- Simulate GPIO interrupt sources with edge detection  
- Support external event triggering from keyboard/file input
- Provide interrupt source enable/disable controls

**Input:** Peripheral configuration and external trigger events
**Output:** Generated interrupts with realistic timing characteristics

**Example Peripheral Simulation:**
```
[TIMER] Configured for 10ms periodic interrupts
[UART] Simulating 9600 baud data reception
[GPIO] Pin 2 configured for falling edge detection
[SIM] Press 'u' to simulate UART data, 'g' for GPIO trigger
```

**Constraints:**
- Timer accuracy: ±1ms for periods >10ms
- UART simulation: support 9600-115200 baud rates
- GPIO edge detection: <1ms response time
- Support minimum 4 simultaneous interrupt sources

## **Difficulty: Hard**

**Task 6.5: Integration with Real-Time Scheduler**

Integrate the interrupt simulation system with your existing cooperative scheduler to demonstrate preemptive behavior where interrupts can suspend normal task execution[1][5].

**Problem Description:**

Real embedded systems must handle interrupts that occur during normal task execution, potentially requiring immediate attention that preempts the current task. Your integration must allow interrupts to suspend cooperative task execution, execute ISRs immediately, and then resume normal scheduling operations while maintaining system timing guarantees[5].

**Requirements:**
- Integrate interrupt controller with existing Task 2 scheduler
- Support interrupt preemption of running tasks
- Implement task suspension and resumption for interrupt handling
- Maintain scheduler timing accuracy during interrupt processing
- Provide interrupt load monitoring and statistics

**Input:** Normal task execution with asynchronous interrupt events
**Output:** Preemptive interrupt handling with scheduler integration

**Example Scheduler Integration:**
```
[SCHEDULER] BackgroundLogger task executing
[IRQ] UART interrupt triggered - suspending current task
[ISR] UART data: "Hello World!" processed
[SCHEDULER] Resuming BackgroundLogger task
[TIMER] Task suspension duration: 0.3ms
[STATS] Interrupt load: 12% CPU utilization
```

**Constraints:**
- Task preemption latency: <100 microseconds
- Scheduler accuracy maintained: ±5% during interrupt load
- Support interrupt nesting with running tasks
- Maximum interrupt load: 50% CPU utilization

---

This completes **Task 6 - IRQ Simulation**, providing comprehensive interrupt handling capabilities that bridge the gap between your cooperative scheduler and real-time embedded system requirements. The interrupt simulation enables testing of time-critical code paths and prepares the foundation for the advanced real-time features in Tasks 7-8[1][5].
