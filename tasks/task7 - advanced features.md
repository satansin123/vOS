# ⚡ Phase 7 – Advanced Features

Here are the complete Advanced Features tasks for your Virtual Embedded OS project, formatted in competitive programming style:

---

## **Problem 7.1: Memory Pool Allocator**

**Difficulty: Hard**

Design a fixed-size memory pool allocator optimized for embedded systems where dynamic memory allocation must be deterministic and fragmentation-free.

**Problem Description:**
Embedded systems often cannot use standard heap allocation due to unpredictable timing and memory fragmentation risks. Your task is to implement a memory pool that pre-allocates fixed-size blocks, provides O(1) allocation and deallocation, tracks memory usage statistics, and prevents fragmentation through deterministic block management. The allocator must be thread-safe and provide debugging capabilities.

**Requirements:**
- Pre-allocate fixed-size memory blocks at initialization
- Provide O(1) allocation and deallocation operations
- Implement free block tracking using efficient data structures
- Support multiple pool sizes for different allocation needs
- Include memory usage statistics and leak detection

**Input:** Pool configuration (block size, block count)
**Output:** Allocated memory blocks or allocation failure status

**Example Memory Pool Usage:**
```cpp
MemoryPool small_pool(100);  // 100 blocks of 64 bytes each
void* ptr = small_pool.allocate();
if (ptr) {
    // Use memory block
    small_pool.deallocate(ptr);
}
small_pool.print_statistics();
// Output: Allocated: 1/100 blocks, Fragmentation: 0%
```

**Constraints:**
- Block sizes must be power of 2 (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 bytes)
- Support minimum 3 different pool sizes simultaneously
- Maximum allocation time: 10 microseconds
- Thread-safe operations required

## **Problem 7.2: Watchdog Timer Implementation**

**Difficulty: Medium**

Implement a watchdog timer system that monitors system responsiveness and triggers recovery actions when the system becomes unresponsive.

**Problem Description:**
Embedded systems require watchdog timers to detect system hangs and automatically recover from failures. Your watchdog implementation must provide configurable timeout periods, require periodic "feeding" to prevent timeouts, support multiple watchdog instances for different system components, and execute recovery callbacks when timeouts occur. The system must be robust against timing attacks and provide clear logging of watchdog events.

**Requirements:**
- Configurable timeout periods (1 second to 60 seconds)
- Require periodic "feed" operations to reset timer
- Support multiple named watchdog instances
- Execute recovery callbacks on timeout
- Provide watchdog status monitoring and logging

**Input:** Watchdog configuration and feed operations
**Output:** Watchdog status and timeout notifications

**Example Watchdog Usage:**
```cpp
Watchdog system_wd("system_main", 10s, [](){
    std::cout ` that allows direct memory access to hardware devices.

**Problem Description:**
In embedded systems, devices are often accessed through memory-mapped I/O where specific memory addresses correspond to device registers. Your task is to create a virtual memory space where reading from or writing to specific addresses automatically triggers the corresponding device operations. This creates a realistic simulation of how bare-metal embedded systems work.

**Requirements:**
- Map memory addresses (0x1000-0xFFFF) to devices
- Support 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit read/write operations
- Validate address ranges and permissions
- Handle unaligned access errors
- Provide memory dump functionality for debugging

**Input:** Memory address and data size
**Output:** Device response or memory content

**Example Usage:**
```cpp
// Map UART to address 0x40001000
memoryMap.mapDevice(0x40001000, uart_device);
// Write to UART data register
memoryMap.write32(0x40001000, 0x48656C6C); // "Hell"
// Read UART status register  
uint32_t status = memoryMap.read32(0x40001004);
```

**Constraints:**
- Address range: 0x1000 to 0xFFFF
- Support aligned access only
- Thread-safe operations required
- Maximum 256 mapped devices

## **Problem 7.5: Hot-Unplug Driver Support**

**Difficulty: Hard**

Implement dynamic driver unloading that safely removes drivers from the system while ensuring no active references remain.

**Problem Description:**
Modern embedded systems often support hot-pluggable devices that can be removed during operation. Your implementation must safely unload drivers by checking for active references, cleaning up memory mappings, removing VFS entries, and properly unloading the DLL. The system must remain stable even if tasks are actively using the device.

**Requirements:**
- Check for active device references before unloading
- Clean up all VFS mappings and memory addresses
- Safely unload DLL and free memory
- Notify dependent tasks of device removal
- Provide graceful degradation for missing devices

**Input:** Driver name or device path
**Output:** Success/failure status with cleanup report

**Example Execution:**
```
unload_driver uart0
[UNLOAD] Checking active references for uart0...
[UNLOAD] Found 2 active tasks using /dev/uart0
[UNLOAD] Notifying dependent tasks...
[UNLOAD] Cleaning up VFS entries...
[UNLOAD] Unmapping memory addresses...
[UNLOAD] Driver uart0 successfully unloaded
```

**Constraints:**
- Must be thread-safe during unload process
- No memory leaks allowed
- Dependent tasks must handle device removal gracefully
- Unload process must complete within 5 seconds
