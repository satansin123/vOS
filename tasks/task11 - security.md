# üõ°Ô∏è Phase 11 ‚Äì Security & Diagnostics

Here are the complete Security & Diagnostics tasks for your Virtual Embedded OS project, formatted in competitive programming style:

## **Problem 11.1: Secure Boot Verification**

**Difficulty: Expert**

Implement a secure boot system that verifies the integrity and authenticity of loaded drivers and system components using cryptographic signatures.

**Problem Description:**
Embedded systems require protection against malicious code injection and tampering. Your secure boot implementation must verify digital signatures of all loaded components, maintain a chain of trust from bootloader through drivers, and refuse to load unsigned or corrupted code. The system should support key revocation and secure key storage.

**Requirements:**
- RSA-2048 or ECDSA-256 signature verification
- Chain of trust validation
- Secure key storage and management
- Driver signature verification before loading
- Boot failure handling and recovery

**Input:** Signed drivers and verification keys
**Output:** Boot verification status and security alerts

**Example Secure Boot Process:**
```
[SECURE] Verifying bootloader signature... OK
[SECURE] Validating certificate chain... OK  
[SECURE] Driver uart.dll signature verification... OK
[SECURE] Driver sensor.dll signature FAILED - refusing to load
[SECURE] Secure boot completed with 1 rejected component
```

**Constraints:**
- Signature verification time:  272 bytes (with MAC)
[CRYPTO] Message integrity verified: HMAC match
[CRYPTO] Key rotation scheduled in 3600 seconds
```

**Constraints:**
- Encryption overhead: <10% performance impact
- Key exchange time: <1 second
- Support minimum 8 concurrent encrypted channels
- HMAC verification must be constant-time

## **Problem 11.5: Audit Logging and Forensics**

**Difficulty: Medium**

Create a comprehensive audit logging system that records security events, system activities, and provides forensic analysis capabilities for incident investigation.

**Problem Description:**
Security incidents in embedded systems require detailed forensic analysis to understand attack vectors and prevent future breaches. Your audit system must log all security-relevant events with precise timestamps, implement tamper-resistant log storage, provide efficient log search and analysis tools, and generate forensic reports for incident response teams.

**Requirements:**
- Log all security events with microsecond-precision timestamps
- Implement tamper-resistant log storage with digital signatures
- Provide efficient log search and filtering capabilities
- Generate automated forensic analysis reports
- Support log export in standard formats (SIEM integration)

**Input:** System security events and forensic queries
**Output:** Audit logs and forensic analysis reports

**Example Audit Logging:**
```
[AUDIT] 2025-06-15 15:07:23.456789 LOGIN_ATTEMPT user=admin src=192.168.1.100
[AUDIT] 2025-06-15 15:07:45.123456 FILE_ACCESS path=/dev/uart0 user=admin
[AUDIT] 2025-06-15 15:08:12.789012 SECURITY_VIOLATION type=buffer_overflow pid=1234
[AUDIT] Forensic analysis: 3 security events in last 60 seconds
[AUDIT] Export complete: security_log_20250615.json (2.1MB)
```

**Constraints:**
- Log entry overhead: <100 microseconds per event
- Log storage: minimum 30 days retention
- Search performance: <1 second for 1 million entries
- Tamper detection: cryptographic signatures for log integrity
