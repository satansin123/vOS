## **Problem 10.1: UART Protocol Stack Implementation**

**Difficulty: Hard**

Implement a complete UART communication stack with configurable baud rates, data framing, flow control, and error detection/correction.

**Problem Description:**
UART is one of the most common communication protocols in embedded systems. Your implementation must handle the complete protocol stack from physical layer simulation (bit timing) through application layer (message framing). Support standard configurations, hardware flow control, and robust error handling for reliable communication.

**Requirements:**
- Support standard baud rates (9600 to 115200)
- Configurable data bits (5-8), parity (None/Even/Odd), stop bits (1-2)
- Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) simulation
- Frame error detection and handling
- Receive/transmit buffer management with overflow protection

**Input:** UART configuration and data messages
**Output:** Formatted UART frames with error status

**Example UART Communication:**
```
[UART0] Config: 115200-8N1, Flow: RTS/CTS
[UART0] TX: "Hello World!" (12 bytes)
[UART0] RX: Frame error detected, requesting retransmission
[UART0] RX: "ACK" (3 bytes, checksum OK)
```

**Constraints:**
- Maximum baud rate: 115200 bps
- Buffer sizes: 256 bytes TX/RX minimum
- Frame error rate simulation: configurable 0-5%
- Flow control response time: 99.99%

## **Problem 10.5: Wireless Protocol Stack (WiFi/Bluetooth Simulation)**

**Difficulty: Expert**

Create a simplified wireless communication stack that simulates WiFi or Bluetooth connections with packet management, connection establishment, and basic security features.

**Problem Description:**
Modern embedded systems increasingly rely on wireless communication. Your wireless stack must simulate connection establishment procedures, handle packet fragmentation and reassembly, implement basic security through connection authentication, manage connection state and quality metrics, and provide application-layer data transfer over the wireless link.

**Requirements:**
- Simulate connection establishment and teardown procedures
- Implement packet fragmentation for large data transfers
- Basic security through connection pairing/authentication
- Connection quality monitoring (signal strength, packet loss)
- Application data transfer with acknowledgment and retransmission

**Input:** Connection parameters and application data
**Output:** Wireless communication status and data transfer results

**Example Wireless Communication:**
```
[WIFI] Scanning for networks...
[WIFI] Found network: "vOS_TestNet" (Signal: -45dBm)
[WIFI] Connecting with credentials...
[WIFI] Connection established, IP: 192.168.1.100
[WIFI] Sending 1024 bytes (fragmented into 3 packets)
[WIFI] ACK received for packets 1,2,3 - Transfer complete
[WIFI] Connection quality: Good (98% packet success rate)
```

**Constraints:**
- Support connection ranges up to 100 meters (simulated)
- Packet size limits: 1500 bytes maximum (Ethernet MTU)
- Connection establishment time: <5 seconds
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
